# Transcardify 🌠
This is a terminal application for creating Anki cards based on highlights(vocabulary) made in e-books.   
It uses [google trans](https://pypi.org/project/googletrans/) for translating the words and [genanki](https://github.com/kerrickstaley/genanki) for generating the cards.  
For providing the definitions the script is making use of the [free dictionary api](https://dictionaryapi.dev/).  
The executable files are made with [pyinstaller](https://pyinstaller.org/en/stable/).


## Prerequisites ✋
- Have [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed 🐍
- Have [google trans](https://pypi.org/project/googletrans/) installed 💬
- Have [genanki](https://github.com/kerrickstaley/genanki) installed 👷

## How to use ℹ️
1. Clone the repository or download the `linux-executable/windows-executable`
2. Get the highlights of the book in a json format.
    > Use [bookcision](https://readwise.io/bookcision) for the json file 
3. Follow the instructions displayed in the terminal after running `main.py` or the `linux-executable`.
4. Import the `apkg` file into Anki.

## Motivation ⛰️
I am not a native english speaker. Therefore I try to become as good as possible in the english language. For that I use different techniques to get better. One of them is learning new words (with their definitions) through study cards, so I started using Anki for it. I also read english books via the kindle app which provides highlighting. I then asked myself how I could import the highlighted words into Anki.
